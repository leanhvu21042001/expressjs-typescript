# My Clean Architecture

This is a sample project to demonstrate my clean architecture approach.

## Overview

The clean architecture is a software design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled modules, each of which encapsulates a specific responsibility. The modules communicate with each other through a well-defined interface, and the dependencies between them are minimized.

The clean architecture pattern is particularly useful in large-scale enterprise applications where the codebase is complex and difficult to maintain. It promotes loose coupling, which makes the code easier to test and modify, and makes it easier to reuse the code in other projects.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
project
├── src
│   ├── application
│   |   ├── use-cases
│   |   ├── dtos
│   ├── domain
│   |   ├── entities
│   |   ├── repositories # repositories interface
│   ├── infrastructure
|   │   |── database
|   |   │── repositories # repositories implementation
│   ├── presentation
|   |   ├── controllers
|   |   ├── adapters
|   |   ├── middlewares
│   ├── shared
```

- `src/application` contains the use cases, which are the entry points of the application. They interact with the domain layer to perform business logic.
- `src/domain` contains the entities and repositories, which define the business logic and data access.
- `src/infrastructure` contains the repositories implementation, which interact with the database or other external resources.
- `src/presentation` contains the controllers, adapters, and middlewares, which handle the HTTP requests and responses.
- `src/shared` contains shared code, such as constants, enums, and utility functions.

## FLow My Clean Architecture

The flow of the application is as follows:

1. The user makes a request to the API endpoint.
2. The request is received by the controller.
3. The controller calls the use case to perform the business logic.
4. The use case interacts with the domain layer to retrieve or modify data.
5. The domain layer interacts with the repositories to retrieve or modify data from the database or other external resources.
6. The repositories interact with the database or other external resources to retrieve or modify data.
7. The data is returned to the use case.
8. The use case returns the data to the controller.
9. The controller returns the response to the user.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the clean architecture pattern is a powerful tool for structuring complex software systems. It promotes loose coupling, which makes the code easier to test and modify, and makes it easier to reuse the code in other projects. By following the clean architecture pattern, you can create a well-organized and maintainable codebase that is easy to extend and maintain.
I hope this helps!
